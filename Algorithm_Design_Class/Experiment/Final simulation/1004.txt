Description
Rocking is a lazy boy. One day his little brother challenged him with a problem. His brother gave him an N*N matrix, and asked him to choose N numbers from the matrix with no two numbers in the same row or column. Certainly there're lots of ways to choose the N numbers. But his brother wanted to see whether Rocking can choose the numbers in a way that it can produce the largest sum by adding up all the N numbers.

Rocking doesn't want to lose, of course, to such a little kid. But also he doesn't like to make efforts on choosing numbers and calculating. So he asks for your help. Please write a program for him to produce the largest sum he could get with the provided matrix.

Input
Input consists of T cases, with T in the first line.

In each case, the first line contains an integer N(1<=N<=16), the size of the matrix.

The next N lines each contain N non-negative integers, as the elements of the matrix, each of them will not exceed 10,000.

Output
For each case, output a single line contains an integer, indicating the largest sum he could get by following the preceding rule.
