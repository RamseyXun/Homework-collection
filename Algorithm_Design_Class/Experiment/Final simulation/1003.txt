Description
 The N cities of Estiah are connected by N-1 roads. The roads are built in a way that it's always possible to travel between any two cities.

Now the king of Estiah wants to pair adjacent cities into defending units. Two cities are adjacent if they are connected directly by a road. Each defending unit consists of exactly two cities, and each city can never be paired into two different defending units.
What the king wants to know is if it's possible to have all the cities paired into defending units. Can you help him ?

Input
 The input consists of several test cases.
The first line of the input is an positive integer indicating the number of test cases following.
Each test case starts with an positive integer N (1<=N<=10000) , which is the number of cities. Cities are numbered from 1 to N.
The next N-1 lines each contains two positive integer A and B, indicating that there is a road connecting city A and city B.

Output
 For each test case, output a line containing "Yes" if there is a way to pair all the cities, or "No" otherwise.
