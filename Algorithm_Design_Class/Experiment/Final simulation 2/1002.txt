Description
 Given a polynomial and the value of the variable x, you task is to calculate the value of the polynomial.

Input
The first line of the input is a positive integer T. T is the number of test cases followed.

In each test case, the first line contains two integer n and x (0<=n<=50, 0<=x<=10000). The second line contains n+1 integers, representing the coefficients of a polynomial from power degree N down to power degree 0, each integer is no less than 0 and no more than 10000.

    

Output
The output of each test case should consist one line, containing the result of the polynomial.﻿
