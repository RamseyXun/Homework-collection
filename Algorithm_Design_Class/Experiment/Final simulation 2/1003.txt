Description
Let us define a regular brackets sequence in the following way:

1. Empty sequence is a regular sequence.

2. If S is a regular sequence, then (S) , [S] and {S} are both regular sequences.

3. If A and B are regular sequences, then AB is a regular sequence.

 

For example, all of the following sequences of characters are regular brackets sequences:

(), [], {}, (){[]}

While the following character sequences are not:

(, [, {, )(, ([)], {[(]

 

Write a program to judge whether a given sequence is a regular bracket sequence or not.

    

Input
 The input may contain several test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the length of the bracket sequence N (1<=N<=100). The second line contains N characters including ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘[‘, ‘]’,’{‘ or ’}’.

Input is terminated by EOF.

Output
For each test case, if the sequence is a regular brackets sequence, output “YES” on a single line, else output “NO”.
