Input
 The first line of the input is a positive integer T. T is the number of test cases followed. Each test case contains a integer L (1<=L<=1000), representing the length of the stick.

Output
 For each test case, output all different right-angled triangles. For each triangle, output one line containing three integers X Y Z, (1<=X<=Y<=Z, X*X+Y*Y=Z*Z). All triangles are sorted in lexicographical order.

Output a blank line after each test case.
