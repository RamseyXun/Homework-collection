Each test case starts with a line containing an integer N, indicating the number of cities.

The next N lines describe a N*N matrix A. the jth element in the ith row indicates the distance between city i and city j is Aij (Aij=Aji). Aij=-1 means city i and city j is not connected.

N=0 indicates the end of the input.
